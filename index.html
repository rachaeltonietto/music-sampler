		<p>Lead singer of the 1975, Matty Healy, pours nothing but the brutal truth into the band's new album: <cite>I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it. </cite> The album hits on some of Healy's favorite topics to sing about: sex, drugs and mischief. It took the band 3 years to release its second album, leaving fans plenty of time to learn every lyric to every song on their first album, <cite>The 1975</cite>. The 1975 is known for its edgy and blunt music, as well as Healy's eccentric look and personality. There isn't an aspect of Healy's life that he withholds sharing through his music. Songs like <cite>UGH!</cite> from the band's second album, and <cite>Menswear</cite> from their first, paint a picture of Healy's reliance on drugs through a third person point of view. Healy has said to like writing about himself as if he is an outsider looking in. The music videos for <cite>Love Me</cite> and <cite>The Sound</cite>, two of the band's more popular songs on their second album, show how the band views fame and the negative feedback received by society towards their music and image. Healy's distinctive writing style, eccentric wardrobe (and makeup) and connection to himself is what makes The 1975 a musical experience comparable to floating in the clouds. Quoted from a member of the band's inner circle, Healy is a walking oxymoron, displaying both "a massive ego, and an extremely low self-esteem."
